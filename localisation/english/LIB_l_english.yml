Opponents of the regime have gathered in the Hinterlands province to declare opposition to the True Whig Party in Monrovia.\n\nHowever, international observers have noted the suspicious circumstances in which the civil war has taken place, as it seems more than likely to be an engineered false-flag crisis by sitting president [LIB.GetLeader] to acquire emergency powers and rule dictatorially."

 ww1_liberia.2.t:0 "Liberia wants in on the action"
 ww1_liberia.2.d:0 "The Republic of Liberia, recently alienated from their Anglo-American buddies, have turned to us to help, likely due to the fact that 75% of their trade is with us. They want to join the Central Powers, and greedily eye the Anglo-French colonies on their border. What say we?"

 ww1_liberia.3.a:0 "Times are a changing..."
 ww1_liberia.4.t:0 "Monrovia asks for a bailout"
 ww1_liberia.4.d:0 "President [LIB.GetLeader] of Liberia has petitioned us today for a loan to try and help them with their current economic turbulence."

Following an unexpected victory by the National Union Party, the new President had been making moves to destroy the vestiges of the 'tyrannical' New Whig Party which had been ruling previously.\n\nToday the president mobilised the army to arrest high-ranking Whig leadership, which has resulted in the Whigs initiating a last-ditch coup to retake power!"

 ww1_liberia.9.t:0 "The Trial of Arthur Barclay"
 ww1_liberia.9.d:0 "Arthur Barclay, previous sitting president and head of the True Whig Party, is being tried for treason today.

 ww1_liberia.9.a:0 "Guilty!"
 ww1_liberia.9.b:0 "Not Guilty!"
 ww1_liberia.10.t:0 "The Trial of Daniel Howard"
 ww1_liberia.10.d:0 "Daniel Howard was to be the next Whig leader, who ran against President [LIB.GetLeader] in the election. It would certainly not be a good look to lock him up, however letting him go free could mean his revenge."

 ww1_liberia.10.b:0 "Not Guilty!"
 ww1_liberia.11.t:0 "True Whig Coup!"
 ww1_liberia.11.d:0 "Our fears have come to pass! What remains of the True Whig Party has gathered what little strength they had left and launched a coup! Luckily, our reformed army was able to repulse the traitors, who have fled to the Hinterlands and now hunker down in the countryside."
